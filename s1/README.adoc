1. Download and configure https://github.com/martsec/big-data-infrastructure-exercises[the app] to run on your machine
2. Familiarize yourself with https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/[`FastAPI`] and the example endpoints and tests
3. Download a couple of files of our https://samples.adsbexchange.com/readsb-hist/2023/11/01/[flights data] and understand it using its https://www.adsbexchange.com/version-2-api-wip/[documentation]
4. Build the exercises found in the files from this folder


TIP: Explore how to write clean and concise code in python. Best practices and testing your code is something that will help you understand what you wrote 6 months ago way.


== How to deliver the solution

1. Commit and push your code to github.
2. Go to your GitHub's commit history, take a screenshot and upload it to campus

I'll use the latest commit shown in the snapshot to evaluate your code.

== How will the exercises be evaluated?

For the parts requiring code, I'll consider the following:

1. Start the application. It does not start -> 0 automatically
2. I'll run a series of data validation tests against your application (6 points)
 * % of passed tests
3. Pass code linting (`ruff`, for best code practices) (1 points)
 * 0 -> 100%
 * 1-3 -> 80%
 * 4-5 -> 60%
 * 6-8 -> 50%
 * >8 -> 0%
4. Performance evaluation (1 point)
 * I'll run the `/aircraft/prepare` in the same computer/server
 * My time for processing 1000 files in a Intel Core Ultra 7 155H over mobile network is 2min
 * I Recommend you test with a lower number of files first 
5. Tests you might have implemented (2 points)
 * Coverage % and completeness
 * Having failing tests result in a 0 for this section

TIP: to ensure you have added all the needed libraries in poetry, 
clone your code in another folder and run `poetry install` and then run the tests/app. 

== Links of interest

TIP: Try not to use Windows and use WSL2 instead: a linux "layer" for windows.
